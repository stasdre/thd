                        <p>As you begin your search for house plans, know that your home’s foundation needs to be set
                            high enough above your finished grade to allow for positive flow of water away from and
                            around your home. Planting beds around the home’s perimeter that will need to be
                            mulched/raised should be considered to allow for enough height. Once your foundation is set,
                            you cannot raise it. Observing a lot by the naked eye can be deceiving, many lots with a few
                            feet of fall “look” perfectly flat. A topo-survey produced by a licensed surveyor should be
                            considered as well as a design professional employed to study drainage, siting of drives and
                            walks, location of septic systems, wells, and outdoor living areas. Adequate planning at
                            this point is necessary to accommodate access for sprinkler systems, lighting systems
                            through the use of pvc sleeves through drives and walks to be able to access all areas you
                            wish to serve.</p>

                    <p>While we all love trees and should do our best to preserve them when we can, trees in close
                        proximity to your home have negative effects on your home as well as the trees. Rodents use
                        trees as an entry point to your home and hazardous weather can turn your trees into projectiles
                        that badly damage your home. Most trees do not do well in close proximity to a foundation
                        either. They need at least 50% of their root system uncovered to have a chance of survival.
                        Consider using porous materials for walks and drives that allow trees within 10 feet to breathe.
                        If fill is required to raise your foundation’s elevation, compaction tests should be conducted
                        by an engineer, after your pad is placed and compacted, to insure your foundation will not
                        settle.

                        <p>Your home’s foundation is the most important piece of the structure and should be designed by
                            a licensed engineer. Soil reports are required for an engineer to adequately analyze the
                            design of your foundation. These steps can take weeks or months to accomplish from start to
                            finish and should not be overlooked. </p>

                        <p>When forms are finally set, dimensions should be triple checked to be certain the layout is
                            correct as well as all steel reinforcing is in place and the correct size as required by
                            your engineer. Your engineer can be hired to inspect elements before they are covered up.
                            Plumbing drain lines will also need to be set in slab foundation as well as any items which
                            need to be embedded in the slab such as conduit, floor outlets, hold downs at the perimeter
                            walls, etc.

                        <p>Framing your home is exciting, however careful planning is still a priority. Laying out your
                            walls with chalk lines on your slab or subfloor are the best way to foresee any issues that
                            need to be addressed before the main level walls are framed. This is a good time to pause
                            and re-walk your floor plan in real scale and time. It is interesting to note that at the
                            framing thru sheetrock stages, the spaces in your home may “seem” smaller than you expected.
                            This is normal and is slightly deceiving.</p>

                        <p>As your framing proceeds, you may notice things in three dimensions that you could not see in
                            two dimensional plans. It’s normal to expect that some deviations to the original plan may
                            be considered for example to make better use of attic and dead spaces. The need for chases
                            for mechanical needs may require stealing space from another area or corner of an ancillary
                            space. Policies need to be discussed with your builder, before you sign a contract with
                            them, as to how these types of change orders are accommodated and paid for. </p>

                        <p>Keep in mind as well that while progress will have seemed to move forward very quickly, this
                            is where the process may begin to seemingly drag on and that’s normal.</p>

                        <p>Once your primary framing is complete it is important to get your home “dried in” as soon as
                            possible to avoid unnecessary weathering of your framing. While shingles aren’t absolutely
                            necessary at this point and may be better timed to wait until after exterior surfaces are
                            installed and painted, asphalt felt paper which is securely fastened to your roof decking as
                            well as water resistant sheathing (whatever is recommended in your region) on the exterior
                            walls in conjunction with windows and at least temporary doors should be installed. Note:
                            Windows typically have a lead time of several weeks to months and need to be ordered early,
                            sometimes even before the foundation is set.</p>

                        <p>If for any reason your home sits in inclement weather for long periods of time, and some form
                            of discoloring or suspected mold begins to form, care should be taken to have tests runs to
                            insure no mold is present, and all areas should be treated prior to covering up effected
                            areas.</p>

                            need to be conducted by either local jurisdictions or private inspection companies. If
                            inspections are not required in your area, we still highly recommend hiring a private
                            inspection company. Most banks will require this if construction financing is used. It is

                            much that can be found in print and on the internet. The temperature range, humidity levels

                            the context of your environment as well. The location of the wrap (outside vs inside), how

                        <p>Interior finish selections can be overwhelming and hiring an interior design professional may
                            be a good idea for those who find themselves in that position. While lead time on most
                            selections is not long, most of these decisions should have been made before you arrive at
                            this point. Appliances, light fixtures, plumbing fixtures will need to be ordered and their
                            delivery coordinated at the appropriate time. </p>

                        <p>Trim and interior doors, millwork and anything that needs paint or stain will go in first
                            then painted. Once all painting/staining has been completed, flooring and granite tops are
                            next, then plumbing fixtures, light fixtures, switches and outlet covers. Care should be
                            taken to protect floor and countertop surfaces while fixtures are being installed.</p>

                        <p>While the idea of a “final walk-thru” is a bit of a misnomer, as warranty items will
                            inevitably come up, and items that were missed in the “final walk-thru” will appear, there
                            does still need to be a final meeting to walk-thru the home with your
                            builder/sub-contractors to create a punch list of items that need to be fixed or completed
                            to your satisfaction and to discuss operation of any systems, like A/C controls, sound and
                            lighting systems, etc. You should also at this time accumulate all of your owner’s manuals
                            for these systems and keep them in a safe place for future reference.</p>
